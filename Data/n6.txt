Dear... The Person Who Wrote That
Hello, you don't know me but I am the person who read your letter. Out of all the letters posted on this site, I have stumbled upon your letter. 

I'd like to believe that out of all the 7 billion people in the world, we really are connected - you and I. 

I couldn't be happier that you have taken the time to write that letter. You brought a smile in my face and decided to write back, hoping that one day you would come back to this site and read my response.

If there's anything you'd like to talk about, write it and I'll make sure you are not speaking to the great void of internet. And I'll cherish this moment that I have stumbled upon your letter and decided to write back.

May you smile more than frown and more happy than not. Thank you!
