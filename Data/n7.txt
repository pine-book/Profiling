Dear... Mom
I really miss you. 

You missed my entire adult life. 

You never got to hear me sing. You always wanted me to sing for you. I'm so sorry. I sing for you now. I sing for you a lot. I hope you know.

I promised you I would go to college. I did, and graduated. I don't know what to do now. It's been 13 years without you. I still think of you all the time. 

I used to have those dreams. Maybe it really was you. Sitting in that room, you in your chair, talking with me for so long, just like we would do on our evening walks when I was a kid. I was going through a really tough time then, and those dreams soothed me. I was really worried about my heart - you were right, my heart is fine, I finally got the ultrasound. 

But you haven't been in my dreams for so long. I miss seeing you there. I don't doubt you'd be thrilled to learn about my life now.

It just isn't the same without you. I love you.

FROM... I WILL SING FOR YOU EVERY DAY UNTIL MY LAST
