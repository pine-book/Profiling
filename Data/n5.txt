Dear... Moose
I want to reach out to you but we ended poorly (my fault, I get it) and we haven't seen or spoken in years. I know I shouldn't, so I'm not, and I'm doing this instead. 

I just wanted to let you know Nugget's not doing too hot. He's got fairly advanced kidney disease and maybe a month left. My husband and I took him to the vet today. I'd like to imagine that you cared for him during our time together so I really do want to reach out and tell you but I know it's out of line. But yeah. Nugget. It's a shame.
