Dear... The Universe
I have tried to trust you. I have put my faith into you. I have believed that you looked out for me, that you knew who I was.

You have made it clear that this is not the case. If you do know me, you do not care about me. You throw shit my way and I pull my way out of it. I find light. So you give me more, and each time itâ€™s worse than the last. You are relentless. 

I have fought for years, but I am getting tired. I am thinking about giving up. You are winning. Are you happy?
FROM... SOMEONE WHO IS TIRED OF THE FIGHT
